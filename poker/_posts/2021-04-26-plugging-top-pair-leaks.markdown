I've had three different hands this week where I payed villain off when I was
pretty darn sure I had the worse hand. The first two I had top pair with a bad
kicker, and the third I had an overpair on a low board. These were all 50NL on
Ignition.

I'm going to describe each of the three hands, look at what a solver does in
these spots, and then try to figure out what _I_ should be doing in the games
I'm playing.
