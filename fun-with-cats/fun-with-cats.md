This is the homepage of the Fun With Cats reading group being offered in the
UMass Amherst CS department. I'm running this group because I like playing with
cats and you should too!

We are primarily working out of Steve Awodey's [Category Theory][awodey-ct] but we are
pulling material from other sources, including [Mac
Lane][maclane-ctwm] (of course) and the relatively new text [Category Theory in
Context][riehl-ctic] by Emily Riehl. I chose Awodey's text because it has very
humble prerequisites and while examples are given from a wide variety of
backgrounds the author develops the main examples from the ground up.

Check out this [writeup](/fun-with-cats/materials/fwc-writeup.pdf) for more
information.
