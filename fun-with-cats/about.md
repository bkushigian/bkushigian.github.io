Fun With Cats is a reading group on category theory offered in the UMass Amherst
CS Department. Here is a [writeup](/fun-with-cats/materials/fwc-writeup.pdf). I decided to run
this group because I want to know more about category theory and this will keep
me accountable to continue learning the material.

I also (not so) secretly harbor the opinion that there is too much productivity
and practicality in computer science. I study computer science for the joy of
the subject---that I can get filthy rich doing it is just a coincidence.
