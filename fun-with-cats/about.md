Fun With Cats is a reading group on category theory offered in the UMass Amherst
CS Department. Here is a [writeup](/materials/fwc-writeup.pdf). I decided to run
this group because I want to know more about category theory and this will keep
me accountable to continue learning the material.

I also (not so) secretly harbor the opinion that there is too much focus on
productivity and practicality in computer science. I am a proponent of studying
computer science for the joy of the subject---that I can get filthy rich is a
happy coincidence.

There is a lot of beauty in computer science that gets passed over for more
practical matters. This makes me sad.

Whence, categories.
