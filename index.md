This is a place to post cool things that I come across. Most of it is probably
only interesting to me but I find having a place to officially put my thoughts
helpful to constrain my thinking.

I like building systems to see how they work and one of my main goals with this
site is to build write about the things I'm investigating. This serves not only
to catalogue my projects so that they aren't lost to my file system, but also
to incentivize me to finish them and get a nice working version of everything I
start.

My interests are in PL, Software Engineering, Verification, Compilers, and
Systems as well as mathematics (in particular algebra and topology). I'm
currently working with [Ren√© Just][rjust-site] at UMass Amherst on Mutation
Analysis.
