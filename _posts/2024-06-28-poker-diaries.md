I think I started playing poker in the summer of 2020, just as COVID was taking
off. I was in a new city and in my down time I was watching chess videos on
youtube. The algorithm started suggesting poker videos, and at first I wasn't
very interested...poker was for shlubby middle aged men sitting around a table.
But I started to watch some videos of Daniel Negreanu and Doug Polk, and I got
interested.  I played on some free sites for a bit, but pretty quickly it became
clear that this wasn't the real game. People need to wager real money for this
game to be played well.

I stared playing on a couple online sites, and I was pretty bad. I had no idea
what I was doing, I was probably spewing chips everywhere. I am an aggressive
player by nature.

But early on I made one of the best investments I think I could have made. I
payed for some entry level coaching from Andrew Brokos, the host of the Thinking
Poker podcast and the author of the Thinking Poker texts on GTO. I learned the
basics of GTO, namely the Ace King Queen game, and was absolutely smitten. I
couldn't stop thinking about it.

As time went on I played more and more, but I was still very bad (spoiler alert:
to this day I'm awful, but a bit less awful than I used to be).
