## what is this?

Things fell through this summer. I thought I would be making good money at an
internship, but due to a combination of bad luck and some unforced errors (I've
never been good at dealing with bureaucracies), I found myself with an
unexpected summer off.  I decided to make the most of it: this summer, for the
first time in my life, I'll be making a living as a full-time professional poker
player. In this series I'll be recording my struggles and experiences,
explaining what I'm working on, and hopefully convincing family and friends that
I'm not a degenerate gambler along the way.

## a word on poker

Poker is fundamentally a game of decision making in the presence of incomplete
information, and with incomplete information comes variance. I will make the
best decisions I can given the partial information I have, and sometimes I'll be
horribly wrong, and sometimes I'll be horribly right. But if I'm good enough,
I'll be right just a little more than I'm wrong, and over time I will win money.

Poker is gambling. However, for a skilled player it is _positive edge_ gambling,
meaning that a good player should profit _in expectation_. In gambling parlance,
we'd say that a skilled player _has an edge_.

Many (most?) folks do not know this: they often group poker with games like
blackjack, craps, slots, etc, games in which everyone loses in the long run and
where there is no edge to be had (this is not quite true, you can gain an edge
in blackjack by counting cards.

There is also a societal morale judgement made about gambling, a common view that
it is full of seedy people, schlubby old men in hoodies, probably reeking of cigarettes
and maybe with a bit of an alcohol problem. And to be honest I kinda get it.
There are definitely some degenerate players, or _degens_, that are not treating
the game with the respect that it deserves. People that have poor impulse
control are often drawn to alcohol and drug abuse, and often drawn to gambling.
But not all players are degens. Some are recreational players, or _recs_, that
like the game but haven't devoted the time to build a solid strategy. They play
within their means, and some of them are even very good. I myself, up until last
week, considered myself a serious rec. Other players are highly skilled players
who have practiced their craft for years. These are the pros. And as of last
week, this is how I view myself.

## what makes a poker pro?

Pros treat poker like a job. They are a mix of grinders, amateur mathematicians,
and scientific researchers. They spend much of their time simply playing poker,
trying to make good decision after good decision. Online pros will play many
tables of poker at once. They have their strategy refined down to a science,
and most spots require little thought or effort; they are rote.

But pros also spend a lot of time studying, trying to get new insights about the
game to get an edge against their competition. This involves working with
_solvers_ and reasoning about different ways of playing a hand (or a _range_ of
hands). There are countless discord servers devoted to discussing poker
strategy, where people can post their hands to get feedback.  "Was this the
right size? Can I polarize in this spot? Should I split my range?  Against this
player type, should I develop a block bet?" A single hand can generate thousands
of words of discussion and lead to many simulations being run.

The game is so complicated that nobody can play it perfectly. This means that
people are always trying to find ways to play as accurately as possible without
simplifying the game to much.

## variance

Variance will be a big part of this series: in some sense, a professional poker
player is exchanging variance for expected profit. Recreational players get
enjoyment from the thrill of gambling, and pros sell recreational players this
thrill in exchange for an expected profit, or what we like to call an _edge_.
A pro might lose a lot of money to a recreational player over the course of any
given session, and the chance this can happen is essentially what the pro is
selling.  However, in the long run, the recreational is going to lose money, and
lots of it.

Every decision we make in life is subject to variance. Which school we go to,
where we work, who we date, etc. Does your kid keep you up all night or does she
sleep soundly through the night? Variance.

As an example, my partner and I, who already knew each other through a mutual
friend, saw each other on the train one day. We'd never really gotten on before,
but she saw me and texted me to come sit down next to her. I did, and we ended
up having a great conversation. I left the train with a burgeoning crush, and a
couple months later we went on our first date.

## what goes into being a pro?

First, a lot of study and hard work. Poker is a complex game, filled with
nuances. A pro needs to learn theory so they can understand the fundamental
mechanics of different spots and how to navigate uncertainty with the minimum
risk and the most upside. A pro also needs to learn about their biases. Humans
are not good at reasoning about risk. Some of us are risk averse. Some of us are
comfortable taking risks. None of us are perfectly balanced. And our biases
change depending on the situation.

For instance, I just quit a session because I was tired and making poor
decisions.  I was getting irritable at people playing poorly, even though that's
who I make my money off of (this is all online so we weren't communicating, I
was just alone in my room grumbling to myself).  I folded some hands that had
enough equity to continue because I was feeling risk averse and didn't want to
make tough decisions later.

In short, I was playing at about 70%, and I'm just not good enough yet to be
able to play profitably when I'm at that level.

<!-- Graveyard -->

We can make all the right choices and still lose.  We can do everything wrong
and win. We all know that life isn't "fair". That is because of variance.

Anyway, back to my unemployment: I suddenly had a summer off and I needed to
make money. I've ground my way up to being a profitable, though inconsistent,
poker player. I haven't always had a ton of time to invest into playing, but
when I do I've found myself getting better and better. I have a relatively
strong theoretical background, but I also have strong intuition, and I like
to combine these things to solve problems in real time. This is essentially what
the day-to-day life of a poker player is all about: solving problems.

So I decided to invest some of my savings into an online poker site and start
playing full time.

I started off slow. Lower stakes ($25 buyins), maybe a few hundred hands a day.
I will play up to 4 tables, but at first I'd only play one or two, and really
focus on my decisions. I did that for a couple weeks, slowly getting back into
the game, and I now feel like I'm just about ready to start playing full time
again.
