I'm wrapping up week three of my little poker experiment and I hit a bit of a
rough patch, so I thought this would be a great time to talk about variance.
I'm going to start off with some some high level stuff about this past week,
then talk about variance for a bit, then get into the nitty gritty details of
some poker spots below.

## recapping the week

In [volume 2]()

An intuitive definition of variance is how much data points differ from the
mean. High variance means lots of different outcomes. Low variance means the
outcomes will be pretty similar.

For instance, suppose we flip a coin for $1. There is a bit of variance there:
sometimes I win $1, sometimes I lose $1. But now suppose we flip a coin for
$1,000,000. There is a _lot_ more variance here. The difference between winning
and losing a million dollars is way higher than the difference between winning
and losing a single dollar.

Anyway, variance dominates our lives, whether we like it or not. We can often
view variance as bad, but I like to think of it as the spice of life. It's what
keeps things interesting. Without it, we'd never have a bad meal, sure, but we'd
also never have an _incredible_ meal.

Variance can be problematic, especially if not approached carefully. See, the
downside of variance can be much costlier than the upside. Going back to our
coin flip game, suppose you and I both actually had a million dollars (exactly
one million). Flipping a coin for a single dollar would have no impact on our
lives, and in fact we could do it thousands of times without statistically
changing our life in the slightest. On average neither of us would win any money
(the man is $0). Flipping for $1,000,000 likewise has a mean of $0, but you
probably feel like it's a much worse idea than flipping for $1. Why? More
variance.

See, the variance is in the amount of money we have, and each additional dollar
we own is worth a little less than the previous dollar. If I am broke and I get
$1,000, I can pay rent, buy groceries, etc. My life went from homeless and
starving to living indoors and being well fed.

But if I have a million dollars and I get $1,000 my life won't change. I might
not even notice!

Think about that: life changing money for the first broke version of me isn't
even noticeable for the second rich version of me. This demonstrates the
_diminishing marginal utility_ of each dollar we own. And understanding this is
crucial when we reason about risk.

Anyway, I don't wanna go too far down that rabbit hole, it's not really the
point. However, I do want to talk about variance and how it affects me as a
poker player and a human being.
