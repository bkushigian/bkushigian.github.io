In a [recent opinion piece][dems-rhetoric-dangerous] in the Washington Post,
Marc Thiessen argues that the rhetoric espoused by Democrats is equally
dangerous to that espoused by Trump. To make his point, Thiessen cites evidence,
each piece of which may be classified as irrelevant or insufficient.

Thiessen's argument is predicated on a false equivalence and can only be taken
in bad faith. He begins by bringing up the recent [arrest of Carlos
Bayon][bayon-arrest] and the 2017 [attack on Steve
Scalise][steve-scalise-attack] by James Hodgkinson, a volunteer on the Bernie
Sanders campaign.

This is presented, one can only conclude, as supporting evidence of Thiessen's
claim that the Democratic Party's rhetoric is equally as dangerous as President
Trump's. To bolster his argument, Thiessen says that

On Hodgkinson Thiessen says

> Before shooting Scalise, Hodgkinson joined Facebook groups such as 'Join the
> Resistance Worldwide' 'Terminate the Republican Party' and 'The Road To Hell Is
> Paved With Republicans'. He posted that..."Republicans are the Taliban of
> the USA." Where did he get the idea to compare Republicans to terrorists?
> Well, just to give one example: During the 2016 campaign, Hillary Clinton
> compared Republicans to al-Qaeda and the Taliban, declaring, "Now, extreme
> views on women we expect that from some of the terrorist groups, we expect
> that from people who don't want to live in the modern world, but it's a little
> hard to take from Republicans."

Okay, let's not get too carried away. Clinton is not calling Republicans the
Taliban or al-Qaeda, and you would have to squint pretty hard to conclude that
she was. Thiessen cleverly uses the word "compares", equivocating Hodgkinson's
comparison of Republicans to terrorists with Clinton's.

But let's compare comparisons, shall we? While Hodgkinson says "Republicans are
the Taliban..." Clinton is specifically saying that Republicans are *not*
terrorists. So yes, they are both comparisons, but not all comparisons are
equal. I will classify this comparison as *insufficient evidence*. Let's move
on.

Thiessen also sneaks some details into his article to strengthen his point:
notice the list of Facebook groups that Hodgkinson belongs to? This is certainly
evidence that Hodgkinson was in an echo chamber, and no doubt the man was
unhinged, but listing these groups in the same breath as Clinton's remark is a
clear ploy to make a mountain out of a mole hill. I classify Hodgkinson's
Facebook activity as *irrelevant*.

He's not done, though. Thiessen says of Bayon:

> And Bayon, the man who threatened Scalise and McMorris Rodgers, was reportedly
> driven to rage over Trump's border policies.

and then links this fact to Sen. Dianne Feinstein's [comment on the Trump
administration's policy of family separation][feinstein-nazi-germany-remark]
"Well, this is the United States of America. It isn't Nazi Germany, and there's
a difference."

Again, and this is important, she is not saying that the Trump administration
*is* Nazi Germany. No, what she is pointing out are very troubling authoritarian
trends in the administration.

Were Feinstein's statements fair? No. Did they go too far? Yes. Should she have
been pressed by her interviewer Chris Hayes for the comparison? Yeah, I think
so. But it was an off the cuff remark made on live television prompted by an
emotionally jarring experience, rather than an escalation of a multi-year long
verbal onslaught against the press. And to be honest, the comparison isn't
totally unfounded.

Look, there is a tricky issue here. Seeing children wailing in cages, placed
there by our government, it's hard *not* to be reminded of some of the worst
episodes of human history. And I'll be honest, Nazi Germany *does* come to mind
for me. But this isn't a comparison that should be made, especially not
publicly, because while the Nazis certainly *did* put people into cages and
camps, and while the Nazis certainly *did* make scapegoats out of a people, they
also did things that are much, much worse, and one cannot invoke the Holocaust
without evoking the worst of the Holocaust.

The point is, Feinstein's comments certainly were not needed for people such as
Bayon to be "driven to rage over Trump's border policy." No, Trump's policy can
drive folks to a rage on it's own, thank you very much, and is deserving of the
scorn and condemnation of every US citizen, and to lay Banyon's delusions and
paranoia at the feet of Feinstein's comment is disingenous and willfully
ignorant. We don't need Feinstein's commentary to notice the human rights
violations that are happening at our border.

Thiessen backtracks a bit at the end of his piece, saying "Let's be clear: No
individual, Democrat or Republican, is responsible for the violent actions of a
deranged person."

Okay, then what was the point of the preceding paragraphs? Either you are
arguing that it's Democratic rhetoric that drove these people over the edge or
you're not. You don't get to bring these up, dangling the examples in the
readers mind, only to not make the ultimate claim.

There is certainly an argument to be made for there being dangerous rhetoric on
both sides, no denying it, and his closing paragraph is more measured and
defensible than the rest of the article. But by the same token it also isn't
really worth mentioning: yes, politics is dirty and it would be great if we
could deescalate the whole affair. What else is new?

Look, context matters, and ignoring it is bad form. Trump isn't letting loose a
single off the cuff remark which amounts to saying "this policy by the US
government which could be mistaken for one enacted by an authoritarian regime
reminds me of Nazi Germany".  He isn't overstepping his bounds slightly, pushing
the envelope a bit.  No, he is saying that the press, a foundation of our
democracy, is the "enemy of the American People," and this is dangerous and
corrosive, not on only to journalists but more to the point to our society.

This really isn't a partisan thing: this is a human thing. Our president is
actively trying to undermine many of the foundations of our society and may be
doing irreparable harm to many of our institutions, and to say "the Democrats
talk smack too" is just burying your head in the sand.

Not to mention that he is the *President*, and that his spouting of hateful
rhetoric is constant. The platform matters, the contexts are different,
and the severity of Trump's language far outstripes any of the rhetoric that
Thiessen offers.

Perhaps Thiessen should take this piece down and write an article entitled
"Putting aside Trump's rhetoric: both sides are out Of hand" for which he might
have an argument. However this argument would be nothing new and of course
wouldn't offer a deflection against the well-founded attacks against the
President.
