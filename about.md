I'm a first year PhD in University of Washington's CSE department working with
[Ren√© Just][rjust-site]. I'm interested in software engineering, programming
languages, and verification.  I'm currently researching the equivalent mutant
problem and applying computer aided reasoning to prove mutant equivalence in JVM
bytecode.
